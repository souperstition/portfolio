# PORTFOLIO

This is the repository for my personal website and portfolio. It was recently updated to include my most recent projects. The website was built using React, and I fetched data from GraphCMS for my projects page.

## BUILT USING

- React
- SCSS
- GraphCMS
- Background images from Unsplash.com

I created the background slideshow using React hooks and CSS transitions. The images are preloaded using the CSS body:after pseudo-selector in order to avoid jumping during the transition.

My goal here was to get out of my usual perfectionist mindset and just get something out there as quickly as possible. This is a challenge for me, because my biggest weakness tends to be agnozing over small details. 

This project was made in a fairly quick flourish, and I ended up being pretty happy with it. I suppose the lesson learned here is to trust the process and just go for it!

## PLANNED REVISIONS
